# Project Ares - OOAD Final Project
### Group Members: Jason Cummings, Alex Burnley, Samunnat Lamichhane

Project Ares is a top-down tanks game employing 3D graphics. The game is two-player and local, with the two players dueling on tile-based maps. The players can customize their tank colors. There is also be a map builder, where users can store and load their custom map configurations.

The files in this repository contain:
* All the required header and source files
* Makefile
* Tile-Maps stored in .txt format
* Models, Shaders, and Textures for graphics

To run, type "make" and "./Ares"

### Current Controls:
P1: WASD to move, Q and E to fire weapons <br>
P2: IJKL; to move, U and O to fire weapons <br>

## NOTE:
This program uses SDL2, assimp, and glm, which may need to be installed on your computer. All can be installed from the command line. Please note however that we never got the chance to test this on a Windows or a Linux machine. All three of us use Mac and OpenGL often doesn't behave between platforms so it's very possible that this will not run other OS's.
